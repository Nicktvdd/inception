# How Docker and Docker Compose Work

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It allows you to package your application and its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container. This container can then be deployed on any system that has Docker installed, ensuring consistency across different environments.

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses YAML files to configure the services that make up your application, allowing you to define things like which images to use, how they should be linked together, and which ports should be exposed.

## Difference between Docker Image Used with Docker Compose and Without Docker Compose

### With Docker Compose

When you use Docker Compose, you typically define multiple services in a `docker-compose.yml` file. Each service may use a different Docker image, and Docker Compose coordinates the creation and linking of these containers according to your configuration.

### Without Docker Compose

Without Docker Compose, you would need to manually run each Docker container separately using the `docker run` command. This can become cumbersome, especially for applications with multiple services that need to be orchestrated together.

## Benefits of Docker Compared to Virtual Machine

- Resource Efficiency: Docker containers share the host system's kernel, making them lightweight compared to virtual machines, which each require their own operating system.
- Faster Startup: Docker containers can start up in seconds, whereas virtual machines often take minutes to boot.
- Consistency: Docker containers ensure consistency across different environments since they encapsulate the application and its dependencies.
- Portability: Docker containers can run on any system that has Docker installed, making it easy to move applications between different environments.

## Pertinence of the Directory Structure

The directory structure you provided seems to be a typical layout for a Dockerized application, with each service (e.g., MariaDB, Nginx, WordPress) organized into separate directories within the `srcs/requirements` directory. This structure is relevant because:

- Organization: It helps organize the various components of the application, making it easier to manage and maintain.
- Isolation: Each service has its own directory, which can contain its Dockerfile, configuration files, and any other necessary files. This isolation helps keep the application modular and makes it easier to understand how each service fits into the overall architecture.
- Consistency: Following a standard directory structure makes it easier for team members to understand the layout of the project and find the files they need. It also helps ensure consistency across different projects.

In summary, Docker and Docker Compose simplify the process of developing, shipping, and running applications by packaging them into containers and providing tools for orchestrating multi-container applications. Compared to virtual machines, Docker offers benefits such as resource efficiency, faster startup times, consistency, and portability. The directory structure you provided helps organize the various components of the Dockerized application and ensures consistency and clarity.
